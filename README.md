> Supervisor: Dr. Truong Thi Dieu Linh (Department of Computer Engineering, B1-801)

## 1. Objectives
* Learn about the basics of Arduino, ARM, and programming for embedded systems;
* Set up basic circuits for reading data from sensors;
* Using MQTT protocol to publish data from sensors and subscribe to fetch the data remotely .

## 2. Files
* `pub.ino` is the C++ code for Arduino Uno to publish data from sensors to MQTT broker;
* `sub.py` is the Python code to subscribe to the MQTT broker and fetch the data from sensors;
* `report.pdf` is the report for this research.
